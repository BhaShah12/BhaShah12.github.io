    <p>Information retrieval is a critical component of crisis response, but it's not always easy to find reliable sources in the midst of chaos. Rumours, gossip, and wild speculation run rampant, leaving authorities scrambling to sort fact from fiction. In this scenario, there is a need for a global, reliable and user friendly application to provide quick and accurate facts to the general masses.</p>

    <header>Dataset employed</header><br>
     <p>CMGE uses the stream of data from social media (Twitter, Reddit), News about an event based on which we can ask queries to the system and get answers based on the news content. </p>
     <p>The CrisisFACT dataset is a collection of tweets that were posted during various crisis events, including natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other emergencies. The dataset was created to help researchers and developers better understand how people use social media during times of crisis and to develop new tools and technologies to support crisis response and recovery efforts.</p>
     <p>For each day during an event, the following content is available:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>Twitter stream: This stream provides real-time updates from Twitter users who are discussing the crisis event. The tweets are collected based on keywords and may include noise or irrelevant content, but they can still provide valuable insights into how people are responding to the event and what information they are sharing.</li>
      <li>Reddit stream: The Reddit stream provides a more in-depth view of how people are discussing the crisis event on social media. The stream includes both the original submission and subsequent comments within relevant threads. While some comments may not be informative, the stream can provide a more detailed understanding of the conversation around the event.</li>
      <li>Facebook stream: The Facebook stream provides posts from public pages that are relevant to the crisis event. While the text content of these posts cannot be directly shared, the post and page IDs are included in the stream, which can be used to manually collect the data.</li>
      <li>News stream: The news stream includes articles from traditional news agencies that are reporting on the crisis event. These articles can provide valuable context and analysis of the event, as well as updates on the latest developments.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Analysing these data streams can provide a more complete picture of the crisis event, including how people are responding, what information they are sharing, and what actions are being taken by authorities and organisations.</p>

    <p>We use the news feed data here(Headings). First, we use a sentence transformer for getting word embeddings of all headings in the news feed and then use cosine similarity to compare these heading embeddings to the input query embeddings and filter out the top n headings and form the context. Then pass this context and the input query to the QnA model and get output.</p>

    <h3>RoBERTa</h3>
    <p>Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach: It is a transformer based-language model developed by Facebook AI Research in 2019. The widely used BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model has been expanded with the help of RoBERTa, which aims to enhance pretraining and boost performance on downstream NLP tasks. A specific version of the RoBERTa model that has been optimized on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) 2.0 is called RoBERTa-Base-SQuAD2. The SQuAD2.0 dataset serves as a benchmark for computer comprehension and asks models to read passages and respond to questions about them.
      
      <br>Based on the context presented in the passage, the RoBERTa-Base-SQuAD2 model is trained to predict the response to a given question. The SQuAD2.0 dataset is used to fine-tune the model after it has been pre-trained on a sizable corpus of text using a combination of supervised learning and transfer learning strategies.
      
      <br>RoBERTa-Base-SQuAD2 model is fine-tuned to increase the odds of correctly predicting an answer to a given question while lowering the likelihood of correctly predicting irrelevant or wrong replies.

      <header>Advanced text formatting</header><br>
    <p>There are many other elements in HTML for formatting text, which we didn't get to in the HTML text fundamentals article. The elements described in this article are less known, but still useful to know about (and this is still not a complete list by any means). Here you'll learn about marking up quotations, description lists, computer code and other related text, subscript and superscript, contact information, and more.</p>
    <p>In HTML text fundamentals, we walked through how to mark up basic lists in HTML, but we didn't mention the third type of list you'll occasionally come across — description lists. The purpose of these lists is to mark up a set of items and their associated descriptions, such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers.Description lists use a different wrapper than the other list types — 	&lt;dl&gt;; in addition each term is wrapped in a 	&lt;dt&gt; (description term) element, and each description is wrapped in a 	&lt;dd&gt; (description definition) element.</p>
    <p>HTML also has features available for marking up quotations; which element you use depends on whether you are marking up a block or inline quotation.f a section of block level content (be it a paragraph, multiple paragraphs, a list, etc.) is quoted from somewhere else, you should wrap it inside a &lt;blockquote&gt;element to signify this, and include a URL pointing to the source of the quote inside a cite attribute. Browser default styling will render this as an indented paragraph, as an indicator that it is a quote.</p>
  <p>You will occasionally need to use superscript and subscript when marking up items like dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations so they have the correct meaning. The &lt;sup&gt;and &lt;sub&gt;elements handle this job. For example:</p><br>
   <div id="codes">
     <code>
      &lt;p&gt;My birthday is on the 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May 2001.&lt;/p&gt;<br>
&lt;p&gt;Caffeine's chemical formula is C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    </code>
     </div>
<br>
<br>
    <p> The output of this code looks like so:</p>
    <p><p>My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2001.</p>
    <p>Caffeine's chemical formula is C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p></p>

      <header>Document and website structure</header><br>
    <p>In addition to defining individual parts of your page (such as "a paragraph" or "an image"), HTML also boasts a number of block level elements used to define areas of your website (such as "the header", "the navigation menu", "the main content column"). This article looks into how to plan a basic website structure, and write the HTML to represent this structure.</p>
  <p>Webpages can and will look pretty different from one another, but they all tend to share similar standard components, unless the page is displaying a fullscreen video or game, is part of some kind of art project, or is just badly structured:</p>
<ul>
<li>header: usually a big strip across the top with a big heading and/or logo. This is where the main common information about a website usually stays from one webpage to another.</li>
<li>navigation bar: links to the site's main sections; usually represented by menu buttons, links, or tabs. Like the header, this content usually remains consistent from one webpage to another — having inconsistent navigation on your website will just lead to confused, frustrated users. Many web designers consider the navigation bar to be part of the header rather than an individual component, but that's not a requirement; in fact, some also argue that having the two separate is better for accessibility, as screen readers can read the two features better if they are separate.</li>
<li>main content: a big area in the center that contains most of the unique content of a given webpage, for example, the video you want to watch, or the main story you're reading, or the map you want to view, or the news headlines, etc. This is the one part of the website that definitely will vary from page to page!</li>
<li>sidebar: some peripheral info, links, quotes, ads, etc. Usually, this is contextual to what is contained in the main content (for example on a news article page, the sidebar might contain the author's bio, or links to related articles) but there are also cases where you'll find some recurring elements like a secondary navigation system.</li>
<li>footer: a strip across the bottom of the page that generally contains fine print, copyright notices, or contact info. It's a place to put common information (like the header) but usually, that information is not critical or secondary to the website itself. The footer is also sometimes used for SEO purposes, by providing links for quick access to popular content.</li>
    </ul>
   <p>In your HTML code, you can mark up sections of content based on their functionality — you can use elements that represent the sections of content described above unambiguously, and assistive technologies like screenreaders can recognise those elements and help with tasks like "find the main navigation", or "find the main content." As we mentioned earlier in the course, there are a number of consequences of not using the right element structure and semantics for the right job. To implement such semantic mark up, HTML provides dedicated tags that you can use to represent such sections, for example:</p>

<p>header: 	&lt;header&gt;.<br>
navigation bar:	&lt;nav&gt;.<br>
main content: 	&lt;main&gt;, with various content subsections represented by 	&lt;article&gt;, 	&lt;section&gt;, and 	&lt;div&gt; elements.<br>
sidebar: 	&lt;aside&gt;; often placed inside 	&lt;main&gt;.<br>
footer: 	&lt;footer&gt;.</p> 
  </section>

     <section class="main-section" id="html_layout_elements">
      <header>HTML layout elements</header><br>
    <p>It's good to understand the overall meaning of all the HTML sectioning elements in detail — this is something you'll work on gradually as you start to get more experience with web development. You can find a lot of detail by reading our HTML element reference. For now, these are the main definitions that you should try to understand:</p>
  <ul>
<li> 	&lt;main&gt; is for content unique to this page. Use 	&lt;main&gt; only once per page, and put it directly inside 	&lt;body&gt;. Ideally this shouldn't be nested within other elements.</li>
<li> 	&lt;article&gt; encloses a block of related content that makes sense on its own without the rest of the page (e.g., a single blog post).</li>
<li>	&lt;section&gt; is similar to 	&lt;article&gt;, but it is more for grouping together a single part of the page that constitutes one single piece of functionality (e.g., a mini map, or a set of article headlines and summaries). It's considered best practice to begin each section with a heading; also note that you can break 	&lt;article&gt;s up into different 	&lt;section&gt;s, or 	&lt;section&gt;s up into different 	&lt;article&gt;s, depending on the context.</li>
<li>	&lt;aside&gt; contains content that is not directly related to the main content but can provide additional information indirectly related to it (glossary entries, author biography, related links, etc.).</li>
<li> 	&lt;header&gt; represents a group of introductory content. If it is a child of 	&lt;body&gt; it defines the global header of a webpage, but if it's a child of an 	&lt;article&gt; or 	&lt;section&gt; it defines a specific header for that section (try not to confuse this with titles and headings).</li>
<li> 	&lt;nav&gt; contains the main navigation functionality for the page. Secondary links, etc., would not go in the navigation.</li>
<li> 	&lt;footer&gt; represents a group of end content for a page.</li>

      <header>Planning a website</header><br>
    <p>Once you've planned out the structure of a simple webpage, the next logical step is to try to work out what content you want to put on a whole website, what pages you need, and how they should be arranged and link to one another for the best possible user experience. This is called Information architecture. In a large, complex website, a lot of planning can go into this process, but for a simple website of a few pages, this can be fairly simple, and fun!</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Bear in mind that you'll have a few elements common to most (if not all) pages — such as the navigation menu, and the footer content. If your site is for a business, for example, it's a good idea to have your contact information available in the footer on each page. Note down what you want to have common to every page.</li>
     <li>Next, draw a rough sketch of what you might want the structure of each page to look like (it might look like our simple website above). Note what each block is going to be.</li>
     <li>Now, brainstorm all the other (not common to every page) content you want to have on your website — write a big list down.</li>
     <li>Next, try to sort all these content items into groups, to give you an idea of what parts might live together on different pages. This is very similar to a technique called Card sorting.</li>
     <li>Now try to sketch a rough sitemap — have a bubble for each page on your site, and draw lines to show the typical workflow between pages. The homepage will probably be in the center, and link to most if not all of the others; most of the pages in a small site should be available from the main navigation, although there are exceptions. You might also want to include notes about how things might be presented.</li>

      <header>Debugging HTML</header><br>
    <p>Writing HTML is fine, but what if something goes wrong, and you can't work out where the error in the code is? This article will introduce you to some tools that can help you find and fix errors in HTML.</p>
    <p>When writing code of some kind, everything is usually fine, until that dreaded moment when an error occurs — you've done something wrong, so your code doesn't work — either not at all, or not quite how you wanted it to. Debugging doesn't have to be scary though —  the key to being comfortable with writing and debugging any programming language or code is familiarity with both the language and the tools.</p>
    <p> HTML's element syntax is arguably a lot easier to understand than a "real programming language" like Rust, JavaScript, or Python. The way that browsers parse HTML is a lot more permissive than how programming languages are run, which is both a good and a bad thing. Generally when you do something wrong in code, there are two main types of error that you'll come across:</p>
<ul>
<li>Syntax errors: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run, like the Rust error shown above. These are usually easy to fix as long as you are familiar with the language's syntax and know what the error messages mean.</li>
<li>Logic errors: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct, but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs incorrectly. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.</li>
    </ul>
<p> HTML itself doesn't suffer from syntax errors because browsers parse it permissively, meaning that the page still displays even if there are syntax errors. Browsers have built-in rules to state how to interpret incorrectly written markup, so you'll get something running, even if it is not what you expected. This, of course, can still be a problem!</p>
   <p>It is easy to search through the lines and find the errors, but what about a huge, complex HTML document?</p>
  <p>The best strategy is to start by running your HTML page through the Markup Validation Service — created and maintained by the W3C, the organization that looks after the specifications that define HTML, CSS, and other web technologies. This webpage takes an HTML document as an input, goes through it, and gives you a report to tell you what is wrong with your HTML.</p>
  <p>The error messages are usually helpful, but sometimes they are not so helpful; with a bit of practice you can work out how to interpret these to fix your code. Let's go through the error messages and what they mean. You'll see that each message comes with a line and column number to help you to locate the error easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>"End tag li implied, but there were open elements" (2 instances): These messages indicate that an element is open that should be closed. The ending tag is implied, but not actually there. The line/column information points to the first line after the line where the closing tag should really be, but this is a good enough clue to see what is wrong.</li>
<li>"Unclosed element strong": This is really easy to understand — a 	&lt;strong&gt; element is unclosed, and the line/column information points right to where it is.</li>
<li>"End tag strong violates nesting rules": This points out the incorrectly nested elements, and the line/column information points out where it is.</li>
<li>"End of file reached when inside an attribute value. Ignoring tag": This one is rather cryptic; it refers to the fact that there is an attribute value not properly formed somewhere, possibly near the end of the file because the end of the file appears inside the attribute value. The fact that the browser doesn't render the link should give us a good clue as to what element is at fault.</li>
"End of file seen and there were open elements": This is a bit ambiguous, but basically refers to the fact there are open elements that need to be properly closed. 
  <li>"Unclosed element ul": This is not very helpful, as the 	&lt;ul&gt; element is closed correctly. This error comes up because the 	&lt;a	&gt; element is not closed, due to the missing closing quote mark.</li>
       </ul>
